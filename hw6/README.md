Compile Instructions:
  BST-AVL: compile using "make", run using "./bst-test"
  Coloring: compile using "make", run using "./color [input file] [output file]"
    where [input file] is the name of your input file and likewise for your
    output file.

Known Problems: The testing suite always froze on my VM for the random 3x5000
  test. I'm not sure if that's just a problem with my personal computer or my
  code.
