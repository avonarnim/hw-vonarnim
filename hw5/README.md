Compile Instructions:
  Traversal: Use "make" and run using "./expr-tester [outputFile]"
    To run on an input, type in the input manually.
  Heaps: Use "make" and run using "./heap-test"
    The makefile assumes the existence of a file called heap-test.cpp.
  Eventsim: Use "make" and run using "./eventsim [inputFile] [outputFile]"

  Design and Approach: There was no special design/approach used to come up with
  these solutions. I largely did not need to use debugging software for this
  homework because part of the search solution was already built-up.

  Known Problems: N/A.
